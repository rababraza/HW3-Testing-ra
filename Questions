This is called the Average class. Within the Average class, there is an average function which computes the average, the arithmetic mean, of the first k elements in the integer array called list. In this case, if k is greater than the length of the array, it will compute the average of all of the elements. Now, if the array is empty, OR k is zero or negative, then the function will return 0.
